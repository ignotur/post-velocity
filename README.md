# post-velocity
Package to compute Bayesian posterior distribution for transversal velocity using parallaxes and proper motions

## Introduction

The transversal velocities of stars are important in many astrophysical applications such as a search for run-away stars and ultra-high velocity white dwarfs.
These velocities are often computed using measured parallaxes and proper motions of stars.
The parallax measurements are often have limited accuracy especially for distances of a few kpc.


## Importance of priors
